# Inventory-Manager
An Inventory Manager I built using Flask and SQLAlchemy

It's split into 4 different Categorization Types
- Type (Like what kind of thing it is)
- Category (What kind of it's type?)
- Subcategory (How you commonly refer to the item)
- Attribute (Things about the item)

This package can be directly deployed to AWS Elastic Beanstalk for hosting. Remember to replace the database information located in `services/database.py`.
